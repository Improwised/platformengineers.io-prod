The company deployed the application on Amazon ECS as containers, while the database was hosted on RDS in two separate AWS regions for staging and production. However, this resulted in latency issues and distrust in the deployment process. Additionally, maintaining the infrastructure in both regions was expensive, and the company needed to reduce costs.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",goal_title:"Challenge",goal_description:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: 18px;\"\u003EConsolidating infrastructure and simplifying deployment can be challenging, requiring careful planning to avoid data loss and downtime during migration. Managing a self-managed Kubernetes cluster can also be complex,&nbsp; and incurring additional costs. Consolidating environments into one region can lead to a single point of failure, highlighting the importance of disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Despite these challenges, a well-planned strategy can result in significant cost reductions and other benefits.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",solution_title:"Solution",solution_description:"\u003Cp style=\"font-size: 18px;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EWe approached this problem by consolidating its infrastructure and automating its deployment process.

Additionally, they moved all of their applications to a single self-managed Kubernetes cluster within the same region.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"font-size: 18px;\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImplementation of CI\u002FCD:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E The company had an existing CI pipeline in Jenkins that was causing a lot of problems, including being injected with crypto malware and requiring new user additions every time the dev team changed. To solve these issues, We have moved the pipeline to Drone CI, which provided container-based pipelines and Github-based login access. This move improved reliability and consistency, resulting in reduced downtime and maintenance costs. CI\u002FCD alerting was also added to Slack, providing developers with immediate notifications of any pipeline issues. To further enhance the infrastructure, namespaces were utilized to separate the staging and production environments within a single Kubernetes cluster.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",outcome_title:"Results",outcome_description:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe implementation of the above steps resulted in the following benefits for Company:\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReduced Monthly Recurring Cost \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E: As a result of consolidating infrastructure and simplifying deployment, a company was able to reduce their monthly recurring infrastructure cost by approximately 70%.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZero down time in migration\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E : During the migration process, one of the challenges that Company faced was ensuring zero downtime as they had a large user base.
